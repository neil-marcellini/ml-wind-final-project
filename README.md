# Sailing and Machine Learning: Predicting Wind Direction

by: Neil Marcellini and Adam Bistagne

As a final project for our Intro to Data Mining course we attempted to create a machine learning model that could predict the wind direction at each second, given the previous few minutes of a sailboat's gps track. Please see the presentation for more details. Although we were unsuccessful we learned a lot. Hopefully someone can expand on our work and a model can be trained to predict the wind direction in the future.
